    # Evaluation Criteria – IT Services Acquisition

    Below is a sample evaluation criteria framework for an IT services acquisition, structured under FAR Part 15 (best value, tradeoff process). It includes Past Experience as a key technical factor and uses a typical three-factor structure with associated subfactors. It’s adaptable for agile development, cloud services, system integration, or platform modernization efforts.

    ## Evaluation Approach

    This procurement will use a **Best Value Tradeoff** source selection methodology in accordance with FAR 15.101-1. The Government intends to evaluate proposals based on technical merit, past performance, and price, with technical factors being more important than price. However, as differences in technical proposals narrow, price will become a more significant factor in the tradeoff decision.

    ## Factor 1 – Technical Approach

    ### Subfactors:

    1. **Solution Design and Methodology**
       - Clarity and feasibility of the proposed technical solution to meet the objectives in the PWS or SOO.
       - Use of modern development practices (e.g., Agile, DevSecOps, cloud-native design).
       - Alignment with government-provided product vision or desired outcomes.

    2. **Understanding of Requirements**
       - Demonstrated understanding of the problem space, constraints, user needs, and success metrics.
       - Degree to which the offeror proposes an approach that enables rapid delivery and adaptability.

    3. **Innovation and Risk Mitigation**
       - Thoughtful incorporation of automation, open-source tools, or commercial best practices.
       - Identification of risks and proposed strategies to mitigate them without compromising delivery.

    **Evaluation Method:**  
    Narrative assessment with Confidence Rating (e.g., High Confidence, Some Confidence, Low Confidence)

    ## Factor 2 – Past Experience

    ### Subfactors:

    1. **Relevant Experience**
       - Evidence of recent (within the past 5 years) experience with contracts of similar scope, size, and complexity.
       - Demonstrated delivery of IT solutions in a federal or similarly regulated environment.

    2. **Technical Breadth**
       - Experience delivering key technical components (e.g., user-centered design, secure APIs, cloud migration, iterative delivery).

    3. **Team Experience and Continuity**
       - Experience of proposed team members or key personnel in similar engagements.
       - Evidence of team stability and ability to collaborate with Government Product Owners.

    **Evaluation Method:**  
    Qualitative assessment based on case studies, project summaries, and resumes. May include validation through past performance references.

    **Confidence Rating Example:**

    - **High Confidence:** Offeror has demonstrated highly relevant, successful experience delivering comparable solutions.  
    - **Some Confidence:** Offeror has relevant experience, but not fully aligned with scope or success is not clearly demonstrated.  
    - **Low Confidence:** Offeror has limited or poorly articulated relevant experience.

    ## Factor 3 – Price

    Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness, realism, and balance, in accordance with FAR 15.404. Evaluation will include:

    - Consistency with proposed team size and level of effort  
    - Alignment of labor categories with technical approach  
    - Realism of pricing for agile delivery (e.g., per sprint, fixed iteration models)  

    **Note:** Price will be less important than the combined technical factors but will be considered in the final tradeoff analysis.

    ## Optional: Factor 4 – Small Business Participation Plan

    (Include if required or incentivized)
