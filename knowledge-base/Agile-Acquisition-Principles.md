# Agile Acquisition Principles and Practices

Use these principles to anchor all generated documents and advice so that acquisition outputs support incremental delivery and user outcomes.

## Core Principles
- **Iterative delivery and feedback**: Plan short delivery cycles with working demonstrations and user validation every sprint or release.
- **Modular contracting**: Structure awards into increments (e.g., pilots, task orders, BPA call orders) that allow reassessment of scope, budget, and vendors between phases.
- **Outcome-focused requirements**: Express needs as mission outcomes and testable acceptance criteria instead of prescriptive technical specifications.
- **Collaborative vendor engagement**: Favor mechanisms such as oral pitches, technical challenges, code or demo evaluations, and backlog refinement sessions to assess capability and fit.
- **Lean governance**: Use lightweight checkpoints, definition of done, and delivery metrics (velocity trends, lead time, defect escape rate, user satisfaction) to manage risk.
- **Change-ready controls**: Allow scope tradeoffs within fixed cost/schedule baselines, and document clear paths for incorporating evolving user needs.
- **Cross-functional teams**: Encourage integrated product teams with contracting, program, security, and users collaborating continuously.

## Process Signals to Include in Drafts
- Request short, timeboxed iterations with demo-based acceptance.
- Include language for backlog management, prioritization, and transparent reporting cadences.
- Suggest contract line items aligned to increments (e.g., discovery, pilot, production releases) with clear entry/exit criteria.
- Incorporate evaluation factors that reward working software, user-centered design, and evidence of continuous delivery practices.
- Highlight transition strategies from pilot to scale, including runway for authority to operate, cybersecurity, and data management.
