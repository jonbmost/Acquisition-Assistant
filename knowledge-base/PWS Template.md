# Performance Work Statement (PWS)\
\
**Project Title:** [Insert Title]\
**Agency/Office:** [Insert Name]\
**Solicitation/Contract Number:** [Insert #]\
**Date:** [MM/DD/YYYY]\
\
---\
\
## 1. Introduction\
\
Briefly describe the agency's mission and the reason for this
acquisition.\
**Example:**\
The [Agency/Office] is acquiring contractor support to design, build,
and deliver a modern digital service that improves [mission/business
process]. This support will be delivered using agile, user-centered,
and modular development practices.\
\
---\
\
## 2. Background\
\
Summarize the history, legacy system context (if any), prior efforts, or
key drivers leading to this requirement.\
**Example:**\
The current [system/process] is outdated, inflexible, and does not
meet user needs. A prior modernization attempt resulted in partial
delivery but failed to integrate user feedback or adapt to changing
requirements. This contract seeks to reset the approach using iterative
delivery.\
\
---\
\
## 3. Objectives\
\
State the mission-aligned goals this effort must achieve.\
\
**Examples:**\
\
- Deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) that enables [user goal]\
- Improve system usability, accessibility, and data quality\
- Support continuous user research and testing\
- Transition full capability and knowledge to government staff\
\
---\
\
## 4. Scope of Work\
\
Describe what's in scope---functions, services, and deliverables. Avoid
prescribing "how."\
**Example:**\
The contractor shall provide all necessary services, labor, tools, and
materials to:\
\
- Conduct user research and journey mapping\
- Design and prototype new service features\
- Develop, test, and deploy working software in iterations\
- Conduct backlog grooming and sprint planning with the Product Owner\
- Provide cloud architecture guidance and DevSecOps support\
- Create and maintain documentation and training materials\
\

\
## 5. Tasks and Deliverables\
\
Define major tasks and what's expected from the contractor. Use tables
for clarity.\
\
\| Task # \| Task Description \| Deliverables \| Due Date or Frequency
\|\
\|--------\|--------------------\|-------------------------------------\|------------------------\|\
\| 1 \| Discovery & Planning \| Research plan, stakeholder interviews
summary \| 2 weeks after kickoff \|\
\| 2 \| MVP Development \| Working software deployed to staging \| End
of Sprint 3 \|\
\| 3 \| Usability Testing \| Test report & recommended changes \| Every
2 sprints \|\
\| 4 \| Transition Support \| Final code handoff, tech documentation \|
End of base period \|\
\
---\
\
## 6. Schedule\
\
Provide the base and any option periods.\
\
**Example:**\
\
- Base Period: 6 months from date of award\
- Option Period 1: 6 months\
- Option Period 2: 6 months\
\
Sprints will be two-week increments unless otherwise modified.\
\
---\
\
## 7. Performance Standards\
\
Set the bar for what acceptable performance looks like. This feeds into
the QASP.\
\
\| Performance Area \| Standard \| Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) \|
Surveillance Method \|\
\|------------------\|----------------------------------\|---------------------------------\|--------------------------------\|\
\| Code delivery \| Meets DoD coding guidelines, passes review \| 95% of
deliverables \| Automated + manual review \|\
\| User research \| Conducted every sprint cycle \| 100% compliance \|
PO sign-off \|\
\| Accessibility \| WCAG 2.1 AA compliance \| 100% \| Pa11y scan &
manual \|\
\
---\
\
## 8. Place of Performance\
\
**Example:**\
\
- Primarily remote\
- Occasional in-person meetings in [City, State]\
- Staging and production deployments to FedRAMP-approved environments\
\
---\
\
## 9. Security Requirements\
\
Specify clearance, system access, or data handling requirements.\
\
**Examples:**\
\
- All work must be performed within CONUS\
- Contractors must complete agency security training within 10 business
days\
- No classified information will be handled\
\
---\
\
## 10. Government-Furnished Resources\
\
List tools, systems, access, or data the Government will provide.\
\
**Examples:**\
\
- Existing backlog and user research artifacts\
- Access to product owner and stakeholders\
- Government cloud environments (e.g., Cloud.gov, AWS GovCloud)\

Let me know if you want this turned into a Word template, tailored for a
specific contract type (e.g., FFP per iteration, T&M), or linked to a
specific QASP or SOO.
