\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Acquisition Strategy Template\
\
Here is a clean, agency-ready Acquisition Strategy Template, suitable for IT, professional services, or agile acquisitions. It reflects guidance from FAR Part 7.1, aligns with best practices from agencies like DHS, DoD, and GSA, and is tailored for both traditional and adaptive acquisition environments.\
\
---\
\
**Project Title:**  \
[Insert Project Name]\
\
**Agency/Office:**  \
[Insert Component/Program Name]\
\
**Acquisition Lead:**  \
[Name, Title, Contact Info]\
\
**Date:**  \
[MM/DD/YYYY]\

\
## 1. Purpose\
\
Briefly state the intent of this document.  \
**Example:**  \
This Acquisition Strategy outlines the approach for procuring [insert requirement], supporting the mission of [agency/program]. It provides the business, technical, and contracting rationale to guide successful acquisition planning, execution, and delivery.\

\
---\
\
## 3. Objectives\
\
Summarize the high-level outcomes expected from the acquisition. Align with SOO/PWS and mission goals.\
\
- Deliver MVP functionality to users within 90 days of award  \
- Reduce system downtime by 50%  \
- Improve user satisfaction through modern, mobile-first interface  \
\
---\
\
## 4. Scope of the Requirement\
\
Define the functional and technical boundaries of what is being procured.\
\
- Software development and deployment  \
- UX research and prototyping  \
- Cloud hosting (FedRAMP Moderate)  \
- Agile coaching and DevSecOps support  \
\
---\
\
## 5. Contract Strategy\
\
### a. Contract Type\
\
- [ ] Firm Fixed Price  \
- [ ] Time & Materials  \
- [ ] Fixed Price Per Iteration (Agile)  \
- [ ] Hybrid (explain)  \
\
**Justification:**  \
[Brief rationale tied to risk, maturity, and measurability.]\
\
### b. Contract Vehicle\
\
- [ ] GSA MAS  \
- [ ] 8(a) STARS III  \
- [ ] NASA SEWP  \
- [ ] Custom IDIQ  \
- [ ] OTA (if applicable)  \
\
**Justification:**  \
[Why this vehicle fits \'96 speed, pool of vendors, scope, etc.]\

## 6. Period of Performance\
\
| Period             | Length    | Notes                            |\
|--------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|\
| Base Period        | X months  | MVP delivery + initial sprints   |\
| Option Period 1    | X months  | Extended feature development     |\
| Option Period 2    | X months  | Sustainment, transition          |\
\
---\
\
## 7. Funding Strategy\
\
- Estimated lifecycle cost: $[XX]M  \
- FY [XXXX] funding available: $[XX]  \
- Follow-on funds contingent on [milestones, options, etc.]\
\
---\
\
## 8. Market Research Summary\
\
- Conducted [RFI, industry day, RFQ, vendor interviews, open source scan]  \
- [#] responses received  \
- Identified viable small business participation  \
- [Summary of commercial viability, innovation, pricing models]  \
\
---\
\
## 9. Evaluation Strategy\
\
Briefly outline the anticipated source selection approach:\
\
- Best Value Tradeoff (Technical, Past Experience, Price)  \
- May use Phased Selection: White Paper \uc0\u8594  Tech Challenge \u8594  Oral Presentation  \
- Confidence-based evaluation (High / Some / Low Confidence)\
\

\
## 10. Risk Management\
\
| Risk                         | Mitigation                                  |\
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\
| Team turnover                | Require transition and knowledge sharing     |\
| Schedule slippage            | Use 2-week sprints, track velocity           |\
| Vendor underperformance      | Tie payment to iteration acceptance/QASP     |\
| Lock-in to proprietary systems | Require modular, open-source components   |\
\
---\
\
## 11. Small Business Strategy\
\
- Set-aside under [e.g., 8(a), WOSB, HUBZone] if applicable  \
- Use of small business GWAC (e.g., STARS III)  \
- Subcontracting goals incorporated (if required)\
\
---\
\
## 12. Data Rights and Transition\
\
- Government requires [Unlimited / GPR / Open Source] rights to all deliverables  \
- All code must be delivered via GitHub/GitLab repository  \
- Transition plan required before end of base period  \
\
---\
\
## 13. Performance Management\
\
- QASP will be used to monitor delivery and code quality  \
- Agile metrics: velocity, sprint burndown, deployment frequency  \
- User satisfaction surveys every [X] months  \
\
